Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's work through this together, shall we?
We will build our first main.cu, sgemm.h and cudaerror.h using meson.
Meson worked great, very happy indeed!
Didn't even need to specifically import the CUDA module.

Alright, let's talk flops.
SGEMM : C = a*A*B + b*C;
A*B: N*N * (A[i,k]*B[k,j]) = N*N*2*N = 2*N^3
A*B+C: 2*N^3 + N^2

And memory:
Loads: 3*N^2
Reads: N^2
	-> 4*N^2

MEMORY COALESCING:
I decided to write the kernels in my own way.
My naive version already kind of deals with the whole coalesced memory access thingy.
410 MB/s

SHARED MEMORY CACHEBLOCKING:
This is a weird one.
We need a loop that walks over the blocks and a loop that walks within the blocks.
I thought I had understood it, but apparently no. 
My version is much slower than the coalesced one :/
Actually, after a lot of debugging:
	--> 480 MB/s
Which is still very slow, but I guess thats expected for a flops-bound operation?
I think I will try the pointer aritmetic magic from the article ... could be neat.
Actually, it went slower. 
Let's keep reading the article and then proceed to the next optimisation.

1D BLOCKTILING:
Uhhh, lets just try to implement it as it is.
I understand how they are doing it, but not why it inceases performance.
I will need to calculate that for my own.
